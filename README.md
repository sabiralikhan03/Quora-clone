Quora Clone (Full-Stack Project)
Developed a Quora-style web application enabling users to create, edit, and delete posts using GET, POST, and PATCH HTTP requests.
Implemented dynamic content rendering with EJS and utilized fake data from NPM for testing.
Built with a Node.js backend and structured for RESTfulÂ operations.

"Before use make sure you have already installed package.json & node_module files from npm".
